# BigRed : A Project for the Ages

This is my third attempt at learning how to use GitHub. Someone from the internet said I shouldn't upload VS specific files, but I don't care. I'm a hobbyist, not a professional programmer. Along those lines: my naming conventions are entirely for my own benefit.

I'm also trying to build a 2D game, though I haven't figured out yet exactly what I want to do. So this project is just a scratchpad for my ideas.
